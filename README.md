# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* I assumed the csv file is small and so loaded csv in memory. But if the csv file is large the current solution will not work
We have to implement caching techniques.
